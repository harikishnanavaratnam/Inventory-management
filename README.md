# Inventory-management
This project is an intelligent backend service that leverages computer vision to analyze product images and match them with relevant entries in an inventory database. Built with FastAPI and powered by the YOLOv8 object detection model, it provides real-time matching suggestions based on visual characteristics and predefined product attributes.
